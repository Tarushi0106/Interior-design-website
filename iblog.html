<h1>Heaven For Aspirants Who Are The Future Of Cinema </h1>
<p>Modeling involves making a representation of something. Creating a tiny, functioning volcano is an example of modeling. Teachers use modeling when they have a class election that represents a larger one, like a presidential election.The Internet loves cats, and so does Anna Speckhart, the model and meme queen whose humorous postings and well-documented kitten obsession have resulted in a healthy online following. But Speckhart is more than her #cattitude hashtag: On her newly launched website, she shares videos tackling everything from questions about the inner workings of the modeling industry to the best way to floss (not as random as it seems— Speckhart’s father and two sisters are dentists). The quirky clips are different from the standard clips, and with YouTube starting to rival Instagram as a career launchpad, Speckhart may be onto something.</p>

            Combining French girl glamour, plus-size fashion, and some of the most delicious-looking recipes around is no small feat, but model Clementine Desseaux’s blog, Bonjour Clem, manages to do it all elegantly. If you ever wanted to know where to find the perfect tarte tatin in Paris, how to get that perfect Charlotte Gainsbourg–esque bedhead, or how to apply Touche Éclat, Desseaux has you covered on all fronts.</h3></a>

      <a href=""/blogpost.html> <h3>Charli Howard has always had something to say. When her former agency deemed her “too heavy” to model at a size 2, Howard took them to task for unrealistic body expectations, and in the months since, Howard has continued to speak out. Her site is a mix of lighthearted posts (on subjects like New York’s best brunch spots) and in-depth think pieces: One minute she’s talking about her complex relationship with the selfie, the next she’s interviewing a glamour model about feminism and the male gaze.</h3></a>

  <a href=""/blogpost.html> <h3>Models travel all around the world for work, but few have documented the journey as richly as model-photographer Emanuela de Paula. Her addictive blog, Manu by Manu, takes the travel diary format and gives it a lifestyle twist. There are immersive destination posts, where De Paula’s images of Portofino or Córdoba are allowed to shine in large format, and personal style advice via some artfully shot self-portraits. Every so often De Paula even focuses her lens on a mouthwatering meal, but the best part may be her descriptions: Delivered in English and Portuguese, they detail the meaning behind each moment</h3></a>

  <a href=""/blogpost.html> <h3>There are plenty of health and fitness blogs out there, but Adrianne Ho’s Sweat the Style offers something different. Showcasing both Ho’s commitment to organic living, clean eating, body-positive fitness, and her busy lifestyle as a model, the blog moves between a sleek visual diary and practical advice about how to stay fit. There are Ho’s prerequisite “outfit of the day” posts (with Ho looking chicer in Nike’s and a T-shirt than anyone has a right to), but those are balanced with recipes for vegan banana bread, tips on how to work out on the cheap, and reviews of everything from quinoa crisps to Beyoncé’s Ivy Park line.</h3></a>
